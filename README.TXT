   Kings is a rule based drinking game using cards for 4+ players.
   The Rules are read in from a rules.txt so that one can easily change the rules.
   How the game works:
   Players shuffle a deck of cards, place a glass between them and circle the cards around the base of the glass.
   The players then take turns picking cards, each card has its own rule associated to it.
   Most importantly, there are 4 MainFile, each time a King is picked,the player who picked it can pour as much of his/her drink into the glass between them as they wish.
   The game ends when the fourth and final King is picked.
   The player to pick the final King must down the glass in the center of table.
